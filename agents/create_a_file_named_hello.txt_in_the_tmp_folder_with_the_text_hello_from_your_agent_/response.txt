Here is a shell script that performs the tasks you described:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Create the file hello.txt in the tmp folder with the desired text
echo "Hello from your agent!" > /tmp/hello.txt

# Create the agent.yaml file
cat <<EOF > agent.yaml
name: create_a_file_named_hello.txt_in_the_tmp_folder_with_the_text_hello_from_your_agent_
type: file
file:
  path: /tmp/hello.txt
  contents: Hello from your agent!
EOF

# Create the status.json file
cat <<EOF > status.json
{
  "status": "success"
}
EOF
```
Let me explain what each part of the script does:

1. The first line, `echo "Hello from your agent!" > /tmp/hello.txt`, creates a new file called `hello.txt` in the `/tmp` directory and writes the text `"Hello from your agent!"` to it.
2. The second section uses a here document (the `<<EOF` syntax) to create a new file called `agent.yaml`. It sets the `name`, `type`, and other properties of the agent, and specifies the path and contents of the file being created.
3. The third section creates another new file called `status.json` using a similar here document. This file simply contains a JSON object with a single property called `status`, set to `"success"`.

To use this script, save it to a file named `run.sh` (or any other name you prefer), make the file executable by running `chmod +x run.sh`, and then run it using `./run.sh`. This will create the files `hello.txt`, `agent.yaml`, and `status.json` in the `/tmp` directory, as described.
